# Computer Programming Exercises - Winter 1403
This repository contains a collection of programming exercises and challenges related to various mathematical and physical concepts, created as part of the Computer Programming course offered during the Winter semester of 1403 at Qom University, Department of Physics. Instructed by Dr.Vahid Jalili and Hasan Kashi as teacher assistant.

## Overview
The exercises are designed to help students in the Department of Physics practice and apply their computational skills to solve problems related to series, integrals, and other mathematical functions commonly used in physics. The problems covered range from basic series manipulations to more complex calculations that require understanding of both physics and programming.
The exercises serve as a foundation for further study in computational physics and programming. We hope students have gained valuable skills in combining physics knowledge with programming techniques, which will prove useful in future academic and professional endeavors.
